# Customer-Segmentation Using K-Means-Clustering in R
This RStudio project demonstrates customer segmentation using K-Means Clustering on simulated retail data. It groups customers based on their annual income and spending score to identify distinct behavioral patterns. The workflow includes:
Data simulation for 200 customers
Visualization of customer distribution
Elbow Method to determine optimal clusters
K-Means clustering implementation
Cluster visualization using ggplot2
This project is ideal for understanding unsupervised learning and its application in marketing analytics and customer profiling.
